# Node Batch
Node Batch allows you to run your JavaScript applications easily with a batch file.

# Requirements
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
- [Git](https://git-scm.org)

# Starting Up
Please follow the steps shown below to ensure this works properly.

`1)` **Locate the `launch.bat` file and open it**

`2)` **Depending what your main file is, you have to change the node `index.js` line to whatever your main file is. If it's the same don't bother updating it**

`3)` **If you had to update the launch line, save it and close the window**

# Launching
Once you have read and completed the 'Starting Up' section of this document, please run the `launch.bat` file.

A command prompt type terminal will open and launch the app itself, if not please open an issue.

# Extending
Node Batch also allows you to update your dependencies without having to use a command or open a terminal shell yourself.

Simply find the `update.bat` file and let Node Batch update your dependencies itself.

Also, the updater will close itself therefore you won't have to close yourself whilst you're busy.
